## Global menu for Ubuntu 20

[![Buy Me A Coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/buy%20me%20a%20coffee-donate-yellow.svg)](https://buymeacoffee.com/gonza)

This project is a fork of gnomehud with the adition of a global menu bar. To install it you have to download this repo and install the extension copying/moving the `fildemGMenu@gonza.com` folder into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`. Then, you have to run the app with `./run.sh`.

The dependencies are the same as gnome-hud:

```
gtk3 bamf linkeybinder3 python python-gobject python-dbus
```

This is a prototype, as I donâ€™t know if people will like or how much it will last until devs nuke it, so fell free to let me know your opinion.
